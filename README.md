# Flurry-Api-Data
Get data from Flurry API by using the API that can be created by the help Flurry Query Builder 
and in Csv Format and put that data in CSV and then it can be used for analysis.

What i am doing is just getting the data for events that i need and saving it in the csv file and then
using that data for analysis.
